>    Implement rate limiter

>    After implementing express, can implement node clusters to serve multiple users- it uses round robbin algo.
    Also can make a separate cluster dedicated only to admin to serve on priority basis.
    NOTE- Only implement after implementing webhook
                IMPLEMENTING CLUSTER AND PM2------WITH EXPRESS SERVER

    Will use round robbin so that response time of the bot can be increased.


>   [last stage] custom remider for users

>   ML

>   Dual MongoDB setup: Primary for reads/writes, Secondary as fallback during downtime.
    Automatic DB failover: If primary connection fails, switch to secondary and alert admin.
    Scheduled sync: Every 2 days, backup from primary is restored to secondary using mongodump/mongorestore.

>    implemented pm2 to automatically start bot in development- pm2-dev bot.js

Implement-

    Admin commands

    Rate limiter

    system abuser detecter- who constantly sends message despite rate limit warning
    autoban exploiters- 
    Steps-
        Req->rate limit exceeded->flagged as abuser-> banned
